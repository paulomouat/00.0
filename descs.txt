ringen
Timbral rings and transformations
cd: vk 1913
This track contains several superimposed 'rings', each having been generated from actual audio fed through a set of narrow filters tuned to specific frequencies and with specific widths.  The outcome is a new timbre, whose spectral content is a result of the tunings of the filters.

Each ring is affected by different types of processing (mainly reverb, granulation, section-freezing and some pitch-shifting), with time-varying amounts, and this will give prominence to each of the rings in turn over time.

The name of the piece (german for 'rings') derives from the concept of rings (the mental image evoked by the process of timbral transformation) and the fact that some resulting timbres sound like a mild ringing of a filter.

The piece was composed with no prescribed form or length, and could conceivably be extended arbitrarily by using additional rings.

This was the first attempt at using the concept.
